ALERT: we do not work stolen wallets, nor recent wallets, only wallets lost more than 8, 9 and 10 years ago, we only want to recover these lost bitcoins, we do not take anything from anyone. If we are lucky I have planned to pay the hunters who participate and donate part of the money to people who really need it.
